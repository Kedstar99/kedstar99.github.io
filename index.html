Welcome to my blog.<br><br>This is my personal sandbox where I document some of the cool things I discover.</p><p>I am a young software developer working as an automation
test engineer at SolarFlare Ltd, Cambridge. This is after
graduating from Imperial College London. After completing my studies,
I am eager to learn and apply my skills
to contribute back to the wider community.</p><p>Currently, I am expanding my soft skills.
At the moment, I have a 240 day streak on duolingo for <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/kedstar99">Portuguese</a>. I am also actively pursuing a
drivers license. This is in addition to a 
variety of personal projects including this website.
Currently, this side is being prototyped
using Actix-Web, Pug and  Bootstrap.</p><p>If you would like to contact me, please feel free to send an email above or send a message on LinkedIn.
For those who wish to speak privately, my PGP public key and email can be found <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&amp;search=0x2D54CBF1F5285B70">here</a>.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to visit my site and I hope that you will visit again sometime.</p></div></div></div><div class="container"><h1>Technical Skills</h1></div><div class="container"><p>So far, I have acquired experience across variety of languages and technical stacks. This
includes C, C++, Java, Rust,
Javascript and Python. I am also familiar with Haskell and Prolog.</p><p>In terms of database languages, I have utilised and trained with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis and Neo4J. Each
have been used in a variety of stacks. A lot of the web projects listed on the project part of this website
were constructed to utilise these technologies.</p><p>I have so far gained some experience designing web sites using NodeJs and Express. I am also somewhat familiar
with HTML5, Pug/Jade,
CSS/SCSS. Front end web design is a rapidly evolving space that I am eager to learn especially with the
advancement of WebAssembly.</p><p>Other technical skills I have acquired includes some proficiency in various scripting and build languages.
These I have used to benefit the
wider community by contributing to various projects including ckb-next, proton, and vlc. If you want to learn
more
about some of these skills, please
feel free to puruse some of the projects I have contributed to. These can be found <a href="/projects">here </a>.</p></div><div class="container"><h1>Experience</h1></div><div class="container"><div class="accordion" id="experienceAccordion"><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="headingOne"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link text-left" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne"><i class="fas fa-industry fa-lg"></i> SolarFlare<br>(May 15th 2018 - Present)</button></h5></div><div class="collapse" id="collapseOne" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#experienceAccordion"><div class="card-body"><p>Since May of 2018, I have been working as an automation engineer at SolarFlare. My role at the
company is primarily to aid in the
development of Runbench. This is a large internal tool which is designed to automate and stress the
capabilities of the NICs within the company.
So far, I have managed to accomplish some success within the company. This includes
the following:</p><ul class="mt-3"><li>Managed to improve/introduce unit test coverage by 50%. Also introduced a Docker mechanism for
enabling unit test coverage of specific system environments.</li><li>Responsible for redesigning and documenting the test RxeqNewRunbench. This test was designed
primarily to check compatability of a pair of NICs with various cables
and switches. Without this test, the company would not have been able to make the 18.2 target.</li><li>Responsible for testing the UEFI capabilities and modules for the NIC.</li><li>Improved the documentation practices within the company by introducing sharelatex company wide.</li><li>Improved the house network website bandwidth by 50%.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="headingTwo"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link collapsed text-left" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseTwo" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseTwo"><i class="fas fa-industry fa-lg"></i> 6 month Placement<br>(April-September 2016)</button></h5></div><div class="collapse" id="collapseTwo" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#experienceAccordion"><div class="card-body"><p>As part of my course, I was required to partake in a 6 month placment in industry. For these 6
months, I worked at a security company present in London.
This experience was enriching as I had the opportunity to build a variety of projects for the
company. This includes the following projects:</p><ul class="mt-3"><li>The first project that I was responsible for was designing a customer portal for the company.
This portal had some unique security requirements
as it needed to serve the company's protected IP. For this project, I made use of various web tools
including Bootstrap, NodeJS + Express and PostgreSQL.
These were all hosted in a microservice system spread across various ESXi VMs. This project
presented some interesting challenges in regards to client and server side authentication.</li><li>The second project undertaken at the company was a project designed to monitor and authenticate
users based on keyboard patterns. This project was a useful experience
in exploring some various debugging capabilities within Linux. For example, I learnt how to create
and utilise shared libraries and LD_PRELOAD. Similar capabilities
were explored using strace and ptrace.
In addition, this task was useful for learning how to build projects that integrate with wider and
larger projects. For example, I learnt how to use scons,
the capabilities of named pipes in Linux and various challenges with serializing and deserializing
data between C/C++. Additionally, I learnt how to use
Google's C++ testing capability to express and test the capabilities of my program.
Similarly, this project made extensive use of pthreads which gave a unique insight into how to
design and overcome concurrency issues within C.</li><li>The third and final project was to improve a internal time-tracking utility used within the
company. The program was designed in C# on Windows so gave some
unique perspectives and challenges which I hadn't faced before. I improved the code base by adding
additional functionality such as checking whether a
user is away from the keyboard. I also learned how to design UIs in XAML/WPF.</li></ul><p>For more information about this internship, please contact me personally for references.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container mt-3"><h1>Education</h1></div><div class="container"><div class="accordion" id="educationAccordion"><div class="card"><div class="card-header" id="headingThree"><h5 class="mb-0"><button class="btn btn-link text-left" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseThree"><i class="fas fa-university fa-lg"></i> Imperial College London<br>Meng Sofware Engineering G600<br>(2013-2017)</button></h5></div><div class="collapse" id="collapseThree" aria-labelledby="headingThree" data-parent="#educationAccordion"><div class="card-body">Successfully completed my MEng course in Software Engineering with a
