    <div class="container">
      <p>During my course and projects, I have gained experience in a variety of languages and technical stacks. This
        includes C, C++, Java, Rust,
        Javascript and Python. I am also familiar with Haskell and Prolog.</p>
      <p>In terms of database languages, I have utilised and traineed with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis and Neo4J. Each
        have been used in a variety of stacks that are
        better detailed in my project section of this website.
      </p>
      <p>For web development, I am familiar with Bootstrap, Node and Jquery. I am also familiar with HTML5, Pug/Jade,
        css/scss. Although I am eager
        to learn new technical stacks as well. At present, I am exploring Yew which is promising to be a new Web
        Assembly based front end toolkit designed in Rust.
      </p>
      <p>Other technical skills I have acquired includes some proficiency in various scripting and build languages.
        These I have used to benefit the
        wider community by contributing to various projects including ckb-next, proton, and vlc. Mostly in the form of
        packaging software for more
        convinient use. I have successfully utilised Docker and Bash for these purposes. If you want to learn more

                For the last 6 months, I have been working as an automation engineer at SolarFlare. My role at the
                company is primarily to aid in the
                development of Runbench. This is a large internal tool which is designed to automate and stress the
                capabilities of the NICs within the company.
                During the past 6 months, I have managed to achieve various successes within the company. This includes
                the following:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>Managed to improve/introduce unit test coverage by 50%. Also introduced a Docker mechanism for
                  enabling unit test coverage of specific system environments.</li>
                <li>Was responsible for redesigning and documenting the test RxeqNewRunbench. This test was designed
                  primarily to check compatability of a pair of NICs with various cables
                  and switches. Without this test, the company would not have been able to make the 18.2 target.
                </li>
                <li>Responsible for testing the UEFI capabilities and modules for the NIC.</li>
                <li>Improved the documentation practices within the company by introducing sharelatex company wide.</li>
                <li>Improved the house network website consumption by 50%.</li>

              <p>
                As part of my course, I was required to partake in a 6 month placment in industry. For these 6
                months, I worked at a security company present in London.
                This experience was interesting as I had a varied time building a variety of projects for the
                company. This includes the following projects:
              </p>
              <ul class="mt-3">
                <li>The first project that I was responsible for was designing a customer portal for the company.
                  This portal had some unique security requirements
                  as it needed to serve the company's protected IP. For this project, I made use of various web tools
                  including Bootstrap, NodeJS + express and postgres.
                  These were all hosted in a microservice system spread across various ESXi VMs. This project was
                  interesting experience as it presented some interesting challenges
                  with respect to encryption. It also enabled me to take a look at how to implement both client and
                  server side SSL.
                </li>
                <li> The second project undertaken at the company was a project designed to monitor and authenticate
                  users based on keyboard patterns. This project was a useful experience
                  in exploring some various debugging capabilities within Linux. For example, I learnt how to create
                  my own shared libary and use LD_PRELOAD to
                  manipulate the dynamic loader in Linux to run my custom debugging functions. Similar capabilities
                  were explored using strace and ptrace.
  
                  In addition, this task was useful for learning how to build projects that integrate with wider and
                  larger projects. For example, I learnt how to use scons,
                  the capabilities of named pipes in Linux and various challenges with serializing and deserializing
                  data between C/C++. Additionally, I learnt how to use
                  Google's C++ testing capability to express and check the functionality of my program. This included
                  how to use friend test to bypass encapsulation in C++.
  
                  Similarly, this project made extensive use of pthreads which gave a unique insight into how to
                  design and overcome concurrency issues within C.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The third and final project was to improve a internal time-tracking utility used within the
                  company. The program was designed in C# on Windows so gave some
                  unique perspectives and challenges which I hadn't faced before. I improved the code base by adding
                  additional functionality such as checking whether a
                  user is away from the keyboard. I also learned how to design UIs in XAML/WPF.
                </li>
              </ul>
