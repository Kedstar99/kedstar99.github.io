              <p>Energy awareness for a specific program can be a difficult aspect to measure. This element is becoming
                increasingly important in an increasingly energy conscious world. Such a problem can currently be
                difficult
                to measure accurately quantify mainly because of the large amount of asynchronous and synchronous
                aspects that make up an Operating System. With advanced schedulers, it is difficult to isolate exactly
                how much energy can be attributed to a specific program. This is manly through the use of various
                techniques
                that buffer and consolidate data across different programs. As such, isolating the energy consumption
                of a specific
                program over it's execution can be difficult.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project explores some of the current techniques that are available to profile energy consumption
                of programs.
                Within this project, I created a technique to profile the energy consumed by the CPU, RAM, GPU, battery
                and network
                components of a given program. This was subsequently tested across a wide range of benchmarks and
                energy efficient/inefficient
                programs that explore the effectiveness of my designed program.
                <br>
                <br>
                I perform this comparison against a large amount of schedulers, governers and hardware along with
                general program comparisons between
                Firefox and Chrome.

                A supervisor at Imperial tasked us with creating a platform for the lending and borrowing of items. The key idea was that the items aren't being used by their owner all the time, and so could be lent out to others who need them. Sharify was created to bring about the closeness that neighbours in smaller towns could have, where they would simply go next door to borrow something they needed.
                <br>
                <br>
                Sharify was developed across three platforms: a website, an Android app and an iOS app. These were serviced by a backend that handled the users, items and transactions. For this project, I was jointly responsible for the web-app for the site.
                For this site, I helped develop routes using NodeJS + Express and MongoDB. I was also responsible for setting up authentication and developing a test framework using Supertest and MochaJS. Finally, I helped design
                the client side iteractions using twitter bootstrap and JQuery.
                <br>

                An example prototype video for the site can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKpMxZB25MM">here</a>. Source code and reports are available on request.
