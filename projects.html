              <p>Energy awareness for a specific program can be a difficult aspect to measure. This element is becoming
                increasingly important in an increasingly energy conscious world. Such a problem can currently be
                difficult
                to measure accurately quantify mainly because of the large amount of asynchronous and synchronous
                aspects that make up an Operating System. With advanced schedulers, it is difficult to isolate exactly
                how much energy can be attributed to a specific program. This is manly through the use of various
                techniques
                that buffer and consolidate data across different programs. As such, isolating the energy consumption
                of a specific
                program over it's execution can be difficult.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project explores some of the current techniques that are available to profile energy consumption
                of programs.
                Within this project, I created a technique to profile the energy consumed by the CPU, RAM, GPU, battery
                and network
                components of a given program. This was subsequently tested across a wide range of benchmarks and
                energy efficient/inefficient
                programs that explore the effectiveness of my designed program.
                <br>
                <br>
                I perform this comparison against a large amount of schedulers, governers and hardware along with
                general program comparisons between
                Firefox and Chrome.

              A supervisor at Imperial tasked us with creating a platform for the lending and borrowing of items. The
              key idea was that the items aren't being used by their owner all the time, and so could be lent out to
              others who need them. Sharify was created to bring about the closeness that neighbours in smaller towns
              could have, where they would simply go next door to borrow something they needed.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sharify was developed across three platforms: a website, an Android app and an iOS app. These were
              serviced by a backend that handled the users, items and transactions. For this project, I was jointly
              responsible for the web-app for the site.
              For this site, I helped develop routes using NodeJS + Express and MongoDB. I was also responsible for
              setting up authentication and developing a test framework using Supertest and MochaJS. Finally, I helped
              design
              the client side iteractions using twitter bootstrap and JQuery.

                for future projects. For this project, I worked with others on the backend which was written using
                NodeJS + express.
                I also helped build the website using bootstrap and jquery along with design the database interactions.

                This was a group project to implement Pintos under the specification listed previously. For this
                project, we needed to
                implement many aspects that are critical for Operating System designs. This includes a expansive
                virtual memory system that
                expands to multiple pages, user programs, scheduling alogirthms including priority donation and
                multi-level-feedback-queues.
                This was a full x86 Operating System that was designed to be run on QEMU.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project tested time management, C99 skills and skills managing concurrent access.

                The WACC coursework was a custom language coursework designed to test the fundamental basics of
                compiler design.
                It was designed to convert a custom statically typed TOY language to ARM7 assembly.

                This was a group project to implement WACC. This project was split up into multiple stages based on
                syntax, semantic
                and code generation. <br> <br>
                For implementing this code, we used ANTLR4 for parsing. This provided a useful tree structure that was
                useful for traversing
                the code. Each of the three stages of syntax, semantic and code generation were implemented using this
                tree.
                <br>
                <br>
                As an extension to this project, we wrote a toy implementation of battleships that successfully ran on
                QEMU.

                As part of first year projects, we created a ARM assembler and emulator in C. This was subsequently
