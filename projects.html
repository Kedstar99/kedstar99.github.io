      <h1>Current Projects and Contributions</h1>
      <p>
        This year, one of my major goals has been to build a larger set of open source contributions. In this venture I
        have
        been rather successful as this year as I have managed to make multiple minor contributions to major projects in
        2018.
        This includes the following contributions.

              Proton is a brand new mechanism introduced by Valve to enable Windows games to run on non-Windows
              platforms. It works by integrating
              various technologies such as WINE and DXVK. These tools translate Windows System calls and DirectX calls
              to those which are Linux compatibles.
              As a result of their use, these technologies have vastly expanded the number of games that are playable
              on Linux.

        Through the above experiences, I have gained a decent amount of experience in contributing to a wide-variety of
        packages.
        This includes following through with feature requests from email all the way to implementation. In addition, I
        learned and applied a wide variety of skills that have proved useful for contributing. This includes the following.
        <ul>
          <li> Successfully utilised Docker to aid in building and packaging a wide variety projects.</li>
          <li> Learned new tricks across various version control platforms including Git, Mercurial and Bazaar. I also learned how to sign my requests and publish them on Launchpad.</li>
          <li> Discovered various linting utilities including clippy (Rust), Pylint and Shellcheck. These have been useful for finding potential problematic areas in open code.</li>
          <li> Learned how to provide meaningful commit messages, and etiquette for pull requests.</li>
        </ul>
        In addition, this year I successfully completed Hacktoberfest. In doing so, contributed to a large variety of
        Rust projects. This was a valuable experience in experiencing commercial Rust development.

              <p>Energy awareness for a specific program can be a difficult aspect to measure. This element is becoming
                increasingly important in an increasingly energy conscious world. Such a problem can currently be
                difficult
                to measure accurately quantify mainly because of the large amount of asynchronous and synchronous
                aspects that make up an Operating System. With advanced schedulers, it is difficult to isolate exactly
                how much energy can be attributed to a specific program. This is manly through the use of various
                techniques
                that buffer and consolidate data across different programs. As such, isolating the energy consumption
                of a specific
                program over it's execution can be difficult.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project explores some of the current techniques that are available to profile energy consumption
                of programs.
                Within this project, I created a technique to profile the energy consumed by the CPU, RAM, GPU, battery
                and network
                components of a given program. This was subsequently tested across a wide range of benchmarks and
                energy efficient/inefficient
                programs that explore the effectiveness of my designed program.
                <br>
                <br>
                I perform this comparison against a large amount of schedulers, governers and hardware along with
                general program comparisons between
                Firefox and Chrome.

              A supervisor at Imperial tasked us with creating a platform for the lending and borrowing of items. The
              key idea was that the items aren't being used by their owner all the time, and so could be lent out to
              others who need them. Sharify was created to bring about the closeness that neighbours in smaller towns
              could have, where they would simply go next door to borrow something they needed.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sharify was developed across three platforms: a website, an Android app and an iOS app. These were
              serviced by a backend that handled the users, items and transactions. For this project, I was jointly
              responsible for the web-app for the site.
              For this site, I helped develop routes using NodeJS + Express and MongoDB. I was also responsible for
              setting up authentication and developing a test framework using Supertest and MochaJS. Finally, I helped
              design
              the client side iteractions using twitter bootstrap and JQuery.
              <br>
              <br>
              An example prototype video for the site can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKpMxZB25MM">here</a>.

                WikiMaster is a quiz app using questions that are automatically generated from Wikipedia articles.
                In this way, the app could quiz a user on almost any topic in the world, which we feel would be rather
                unique.

                In many ways, this project layed the foundation for our architecture and project flow that proved
                successful
                for future projects. For this project, I worked with others on the backend which was written using
                NodeJS + express.
                I also helped build the website using bootstrap and jquery along with design the database interactions.

                This project was chosen to be demonstrated for the department's open day.
                Source code is available for this project on request.

                This was a group project to implement Pintos under the specification listed previously. For this
                project, we needed to
                implement many aspects that are critical for Operating System designs. This includes a expansive
                virtual memory system that
                expands to multiple pages, user programs, scheduling alogirthms including priority donation and
                multi-level-feedback-queues.
                This was a full x86 Operating System that was designed to be run on QEMU.
                <br>
                <br>
                This project tested time management, C99 skills and skills managing concurrent access.

                The WACC coursework was a custom language coursework designed to test the fundamental basics of
                compiler design.
                It was designed to convert a custom statically typed TOY language to ARM7 assembly. This project
                was written in Java.

                This was a group project to implement WACC. This project was split up into multiple stages based on
                syntax, semantic
                and code generation.<br> <br>
                For implementing this code, we used ANTLR4 for parsing. This provided a useful tree structure that was
                useful for traversing
                the code. Each of the three stages of syntax, semantic and code generation were implemented using this
                tree. This is because the tree enabled the use of the visitor pattern which was an elegant approach to 
                only visiting the nodes that we care about. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As an extension to this project, we wrote a toy implementation of battleships that successfully ran on
                QEMU.

                  As part of first year projects, we created a ARM assembler and emulator in C. This was subsequently
                  used to write a custom
                  assembly script that ran leds in a specific pattern in bare-metal assembly.
