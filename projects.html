packages. This includes learning to follow through with feature requests from email and permissioning to
implementation. In addition, I have learnt and applied a wide variety of skills that have proved useful for
contributing. This includes the
following.</p><ul><li>Successfully utilised Docker to aid in building and packaging a wide variety projects.</li><li>Learned new tricks across various version control platforms including Git, Mercurial and Bazaar. I also
learned how to sign my requests and publish them on Launchpad.</li><li>Discovered various linting utilities including clippy (Rust), Pylint and Shellcheck. These have been
useful for finding potential problematic areas in open code.</li><li>Learned how to provide meaningful commit messages, and etiquette for pull requests.</li></ul>In addition, this year I successfully completed Hacktoberfest. In doing so, contributed to a large variety of
Rust projects. This was a valuable experience in experiencing commercial Rust development.<p></p><div class="row"><div class="col"><div class="carousel slide" id="carouselIndicators" data-ride="carousel"><div class="carousel-inner"><div class="carousel-item active"><img class="d-block w-100" src="/images/hacktoberfest2018.webp" alt="hacktoberfest 2018 picture"></div><div class="carousel-item"><img class="d-block w-100" src="/images/hacktoberfest2019.webp" alt="hacktoberfest 2019 picture"></div></div><a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselIndicators" role="button" data-slide="prev"><span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="sr-only">Previous</span></a><a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselIndicators" role="button" data-slide="next"><span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span><span class="sr-only">Next</span></a></div></div></div></div></div><div class="project-header mt-5 mx-auto"><div class="container"><h1>Academic Projects</h1><p>These projects were completed during my time studying at Imperial.

This element is becoming
increasingly important in an increasingly energy conscious world. In software, enerrgy usage is 
a difficult measure to quantify mainly because of the large amount of asynchronous and synchronous
aspects that make up an Operating System. With advanced schedulers, it is difficult to isolate exactly
how much energy can be attributed to a specific program. This is manly through the use of various
techniques that buffer and consolidate data across different programs. As such, isolating the energy consumption
of a specific program over it's execution can be difficult.<br><br>This project explores some of the current techniques that are available to profile energy consumption
of programs. Within this project, I created a technique to profile the energy consumed by the CPU, RAM, GPU, battery
and network components of a given program. This was subsequently tested across a wide range of benchmarks and
energy efficient/inefficient programs that explore the effectiveness of my profiler.<br><br>I perform this comparison against a large amount of schedulers, governers and hardware along with
general program comparisons between
Firefox and Chrome.

The
key idea was that the items aren't being used by their owner all the time, and so could be lent out to
others who need them. Sharify was created to bring about the closeness that neighbours in smaller towns
could have, where they would simply go next door to borrow something they needed.<br><br>Sharify was developed across three platforms: a website, an Android app and an iOS app. These were
serviced by a backend that handled the users, items and transactions. For this project, I was 
responsible for the web-app for the site.
For this site, I helped develop routes using NodeJS + Express and MongoDB. I was also responsible for
setting up authentication and developing a test framework using Supertest and MochaJS. Finally, I helped
design the client side iteractions using twitter bootstrap and JQuery.<br><br>An example prototype video for the site can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKpMxZB25MM">here.</a> Source code and reports for this project are available on request.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-md-6 mt-5"><div class="project-card g-100"><img class="project-card-img-top" src="/images/wikimaster.webp" alt="WikiMaster Image"><div class="project-card-content"><div class="project-card-title"><i class="show fa fa-ellipsis-v fa-lg float-right mt-2"></i><h5>Wikimaster, A Wikipedia-based quiz game</h5></div><p class="project-card-text">WikiMaster is a quiz app using questions that are automatically generated from Wikipedia articles.

successful for future projects. For this project, I worked with others on the backend which was written using
