          | This year, one of my major goals has been to build a larger set of open source contributions. In this venture I
          | have been rather successful. This year I have managed to make multiple contributions to a variety of major projects.
          | This includes the following contributions.

                | Proton is a brand new mechanism introduced by Valve to enable Windows games to run on non-Windows
                | platforms. It works by integrating
                | various technologies such as WINE and DXVK. These tools translate Windows System calls and DirectX calls
                | to those which are Linux compatibles.
                | As a result of their use, these technologies have vastly expanded the number of games that are playable

                  | increasingly important in an increasingly energy conscious world. In software, enerrgy usage is 
                  | a difficult measure to quantify mainly because of the large amount of asynchronous and synchronous
                  | aspects that make up an Operating System. With advanced schedulers, it is difficult to isolate exactly
                  | how much energy can be attributed to a specific program. This is manly through the use of various
                  | techniques that buffer and consolidate data across different programs. As such, isolating the energy consumption
                  | of a specific program over it's execution can be difficult.

                | A supervisor at Imperial tasked us with creating a platform for the lending and borrowing of items. The
                | key idea was that the items aren't being used by their owner all the time, and so could be lent out to
                | others who need them. Sharify was created to bring about the closeness that neighbours in smaller towns
                | could have, where they would simply go next door to borrow something they needed.

                  | This was a group project to implement WACC. This project was split up into multiple stages based on
                  | syntax, semantic
                  | and code generation.

                  |  For implementing this code, we used ANTLR4 for parsing. This provided a useful tree structure that was
                  |  useful for traversing
                  |  the code. Each of the three stages of syntax, semantic and code generation were implemented using this
                  |  tree. This is because the tree enabled the use of the visitor pattern which was an elegant approach to
                  |  only visiting the nodes that we care about.

                  | As an extension to this project, we wrote a toy implementation of battleships that successfully ran on
                  | QEMU.

                    | As part of first year projects, we created a ARM assembler and emulator in C. This was subsequently
                    | used to write a custom
                    | assembly script that ran leds in a specific pattern in bare-metal assembly.
