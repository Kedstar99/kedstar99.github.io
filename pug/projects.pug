                  | This was a group project to implement Pintos under the specification listed previously. For this
                  | project, we needed to
                  | implement many aspects that are critical for Operating System designs. This includes a expansive
                  | virtual memory system that
                  | expands to multiple pages, user programs, scheduling alogirthms including priority donation and
                  | multi-level-feedback-queues.
                  | This was a full x86 Operating System that was designed to be run on QEMU.

                  | This was a group project to implement WACC. This project was split up into multiple stages based on
                  | syntax, semantic
                  | and code generation.

                  |  For implementing this code, we used ANTLR4 for parsing. This provided a useful tree structure that was
                  |  useful for traversing
                  |  the code. Each of the three stages of syntax, semantic and code generation were implemented using this
                  |  tree. This is because the tree enabled the use of the visitor pattern which was an elegant approach to
                  |  only visiting the nodes that we care about.
